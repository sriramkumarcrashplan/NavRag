# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Nanobrowser is an open-source AI web automation Chrome extension that runs multi-agent systems locally in the browser. It's a free alternative to OpenAI Operator with support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, etc.).

## Development Commands

**Package Manager**: Always use `pnpm` (required, configured in Cursor rules)

**Core Commands**:
- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm dev` - Start development mode with hot reload
- `pnpm build` - Build production version
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `pnpm prettier` - Format code with Prettier

**Testing**:
- `pnpm e2e` - Run end-to-end tests (builds and zips first)
- `pnpm zip` - Create extension zip for distribution

**Cleaning**:
- `pnpm clean` - Clean all build artifacts and node_modules
- `pnpm clean:bundle` - Clean just build outputs
- `pnpm clean:install` - Clean node_modules and reinstall dependencies
- `pnpm update-version` - Update version across all packages

## Architecture

This is a **monorepo** using **Turbo** for build orchestration and **pnpm workspaces**.

### Workspace Structure

**Core Extension**:
- `chrome-extension/` - Main Chrome extension manifest and background scripts
  - `src/background/` - Background service worker with multi-agent system
  - `src/background/agent/` - AI agent implementations (Navigator, Planner, Validator)
  - `src/background/browser/` - Browser automation and DOM manipulation

**UI Pages** (`pages/`):
- `side-panel/` - Main chat interface (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- `options/` - Extension settings page (React + TypeScript)
- `content/` - Content script for page injection

**Shared Packages** (`packages/`):
- `shared/` - Common utilities and types
- `storage/` - Chrome extension storage abstraction
- `ui/` - Shared React components
- `schema-utils/` - Validation schemas
- `i18n/` - Internationalization

### Multi-Agent System

The core AI system consists of three specialized agents:
- **Navigator** - Handles DOM interactions and web navigation
- **Planner** - High-level task planning and strategy
- **Validator** - Validates task completion and results

Located in `chrome-extension/src/background/agent/agents/`

### Build System

- **Turbo** manages task dependencies and caching
- **Vite** bundles each workspace independently
- **TypeScript** with strict configuration across all packages
- **ESLint** + **Prettier** for code quality
- Each workspace has its own `vite.config.mts` and `tsconfig.json`

### Key Technologies

- **Chrome Extension Manifest V3**
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for bundling
- **Puppeteer** for browser automation
- **Chrome APIs** for browser automation
- **LangChain.js** for LLM integration

## Development Notes

- Extension loads as unpacked from `dist/` directory after build
- Hot reload works in development mode via Vite HMR
- Background scripts run as service workers (Manifest V3)
- Content scripts inject into web pages for DOM access
- Multi-agent coordination happens through Chrome messaging APIs

## Testing Extension

After building, load the extension:
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `dist/` directory

## Internationalization (i18n)

### Key Naming Convention
Follow the structured naming pattern: `component_category_specificAction_state`

**Semantic Prefixes by Component:**
- `bg_` - Background service worker operations
- `exec_` - Executor/agent execution lifecycle  
- `act_` - Agent actions and web automation
- `errors_` - Global error messages
- `options_` - Settings page components
- `chat_` - Chat interface elements
- `nav_` - Navigation elements
- `permissions_` - Permission-related messages

**State-Based Suffixes:**
- `_start` - Action beginning (e.g., `act_goToUrl_start`)
- `_ok` - Successful completion (e.g., `act_goToUrl_ok`) 
- `_fail` - Failure state (e.g., `exec_task_fail`)
- `_cancel` - Cancelled operation
- `_pause` - Paused state

**Error Categorization:**
- `_errors_` subcategory for component-specific errors
- Global `errors_` prefix for system-wide errors
- Descriptive error names (e.g., `act_errors_elementNotExist`)

**Command Structure:**
- `_cmd_` for command-related messages (e.g., `bg_cmd_newTask_noTask`)
- `_setup_` for configuration issues (e.g., `bg_setup_noApiKeys`)

### Usage
```typescript
import { t } from '@extension/i18n';

// Simple message
t('bg_errors_noTabId')

// With placeholders
t('act_click_ok', ['5', 'Submit Button'])
```

### Placeholders
Use Chrome i18n placeholder format with proper definitions:
```json
{
  "act_goToUrl_start": {
    "message": "Navigating to $URL$",
    "placeholders": {
      "url": {
        "content": "$1",
        "example": "https://example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use descriptive, self-documenting key names
- Separate user-facing strings from internal/log strings
- Follow hierarchical naming for maintainability
- Add placeholders with examples for dynamic content
- Group related keys by component prefix

## Code Quality Standards

### Development Principles
- **Simple but Complete Solutions**: Write straightforward, well-documented code that fully addresses requirements
- **Modular Design**: Structure code into focused, single-responsibility modules and functions
- **Testability**: Design components to be easily testable with clear inputs/outputs and minimal dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system for better code reliability and maintainability

### Code Organization
- Extract reusable logic into utility functions or shared packages
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming

### Quality Assurance
- Run `pnpm type-check` before committing to catch TypeScript errors
- Use `pnpm lint` to maintain code style consistency
- Write unit tests for business logic and utility functions
- Test UI components in isolation when possible

### Security Guidelines
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs, especially URLs, file paths, and form data
- **Credential Management**: Never log, commit, or expose API keys, tokens, or sensitive configuration
- **Content Security Policy**: Respect CSP restrictions and avoid `eval()` or dynamic code execution
- **Permission Principle**: Request minimal Chrome extension permissions required for functionality
- **Data Privacy**: Handle user data securely and avoid unnecessary data collection or storage
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize content before rendering, especially when injecting into web pages
- **URL Validation**: Validate and restrict navigation to prevent malicious redirects
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages or logs

## Important Reminders

- Always use `pnpm` package manager (required for this project)
- Node.js version must be >=22.12.0
- Turbo manages task dependencies and caching across workspaces
- Extension builds to `dist/` directory which is loaded as unpacked extension
- Chrome/Edge only - Firefox is not supported
